# Severity Breakdown Layout Improvements

## Overview
Fixed layout issues in the Severity Breakdown component where text was overflowing and cards were not properly contained. The improvements ensure better text layout, proper spacing, and responsive design.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Card Container Layout**
**Problem**: Text was going outside card boundaries, poor spacing between cards
**Solution**: 
- Increased padding from 8px to 12px for better spacing
- Added `justifyContent: 'space-between'` for even distribution
- Increased gap between cards from 4px to 8px
- Added `minHeight: 160` to ensure consistent card heights

### 2. **Card Title Overflow**
**Problem**: Long severity titles were overflowing
**Solution**:
- Reduced font size from 16px to 13px
- Added `numberOfLines={2}` and `ellipsizeMode="tail"`
- Added `lineHeight: 16` for better text spacing
- Added horizontal padding to card header

### 3. **Stats Grid Layout**
**Problem**: Stat items were cramped and text was overlapping
**Solution**:
- Reduced font sizes: statText from 12px to 10px, statValue from 12px to 11px
- Reduced dot size from 8px to 6px for better proportion
- Added `flexShrink: 0` to dots to prevent shrinking
- Added `minWidth: 20` to stat values for consistent alignment
- Added `textAlign: 'right'` to stat values
- Increased margins and padding for better spacing

### 4. **View Chart Button**
**Problem**: Button was too large for small cards
**Solution**:
- Reduced font size from 14px to 11px
- Added `minWidth: 80` for consistency
- Increased border radius from 12px to 16px for modern look
- Added `marginTop: 4` for better spacing

### 5. **Responsive Design**
**Problem**: Cards didn't adapt well to different screen sizes
**Solution**:
- Created `getCardWidth()` function for responsive card sizing
- Minimum card width of 100px to prevent over-compression
- Dynamic width calculation based on available screen space

## Code Changes Summary

### Container Styles
```typescript
defectCardsContainer: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
  paddingHorizontal: 12,        // Increased from 8
  gap: 8,                       // Increased from 4
  justifyContent: 'space-between', // Added
},

defectCard: {
  flex: 1,
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  borderRadius: 8,
  padding: 12,                  // Increased from 8
  borderTopWidth: 3,
  shadowColor: '#000',
  shadowOpacity: 0.08,
  shadowRadius: 4,
  elevation: 2,
  minHeight: 160,               // Added
  maxWidth: getCardWidth(),     // Made responsive
},
```

### Text Improvements
```typescript
defectCardTitle: {
  fontSize: 13,                 // Reduced from 16
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  textAlign: 'center',
  marginBottom: 6,              // Increased from 2
  lineHeight: 16,               // Added
},

// Added numberOfLines and ellipsizeMode to JSX
<Text 
  style={[styles.defectCardTitle, { color }]}
  numberOfLines={2}
  ellipsizeMode="tail"
>
  {title}
</Text>
```

### Stats Layout
```typescript
statText: {
  fontSize: 10,                 // Reduced from 12
  color: '#6b7280',
  fontWeight: '500',
  flex: 1,
  textAlign: 'left',            // Added
},

statValue: {
  fontSize: 11,                 // Reduced from 12
  color: '#1a2a5c',
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  minWidth: 20,                 // Added
  textAlign: 'right',           // Added
},
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Text Containment**: All text now stays within card boundaries
2. **Improved Readability**: Better font sizes and spacing for small cards
3. **Consistent Layout**: Cards maintain uniform height and spacing
4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
5. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern look with proper spacing
6. **Better UX**: Easier to read and interact with on mobile devices

## Testing
- Tested on different screen sizes
- Verified text doesn't overflow
- Confirmed pie chart functionality still works
- All unit tests pass

The layout improvements ensure the Severity Breakdown component looks professional and functions well across different device sizes while maintaining the pie chart functionality.
