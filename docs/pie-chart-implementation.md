# Pie Chart Implementation in Severity Breakdown

## Overview
The Severity Breakdown component now includes a fully functional pie chart that displays when users click the "View Chart" button for any severity level (High, Medium, or Low).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Interactive Pie Chart
- **Library Used**: `react-native-pie-chart` (already installed in the project)
- **Chart Type**: Doughnut chart with a white center
- **Size**: 200x200 pixels
- **Interactive**: Opens in a modal when "View Chart" button is clicked

### 2. Data Visualization
The pie chart displays the following defect statuses with distinct colors:
- **NEW**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **FIXED**: Green (#22c55e) 
- **CLOSED**: Dark Green (#16a34a)
- **OPEN**: Yellow (#eab308)
- **REOPEN**: Red (#ef4444)
- **REJECT**: Dark Red (#7f1d1d)
- **DUPLICATE**: Gray (#6b7280)

### 3. Smart Data Filtering
- Only displays segments with values greater than 0
- Automatically calculates percentages
- Shows total defect count prominently

### 4. Legend and Details
- Color-coded legend below the chart
- Shows both count and percentage for each status
- Clean, readable layout

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction
1. User views the Severity Breakdown cards (High, Medium, Low)
2. User clicks "View Chart" button on any severity card
3. Modal opens displaying the pie chart for that severity level

### 2. Data Processing
```typescript
const segments = [
  { value: data.new, color: '#3b82f6', label: 'NEW' },
  { value: data.fixed, color: '#22c55e', label: 'FIXED' },
  // ... other statuses
].filter(segment => segment.value > 0);

const series = segments.map(segment => ({
  value: segment.value,
  color: segment.color,
}));
```

### 3. Chart Rendering
```typescript
<PieChart
  widthAndHeight={200}
  series={series}
  cover={{ radius: 0.45, color: '#FFF' }}
/>
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- `react-native-pie-chart`: For rendering the pie chart
- `react-native-svg`: Required by the pie chart library (already installed)
- `react-native-vector-icons`: For the close button icon

### Component Structure
- **SeverityBreakdown.tsx**: Main component with pie chart functionality
- **Modal**: Contains the pie chart and legend
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Styling
- Consistent with the existing app design
- Uses the same color scheme as the severity cards
- Professional, clean appearance

## Testing
Unit tests have been implemented to verify:
- Correct data structure for pie chart
- Accurate percentage calculations
- Proper filtering of zero-value segments

## Usage Example
```typescript
const defectData = {
  high: {
    total: 25,
    new: 5,
    fixed: 8,
    closed: 7,
    open: 3,
    reopen: 1,
    reject: 1,
    duplicate: 0
  },
  // ... medium and low data
};

<SeverityBreakdown defectData={defectData} />
```

## Benefits
1. **Visual Clarity**: Easy to understand defect distribution at a glance
2. **Interactive**: Users can drill down into specific severity levels
3. **Responsive**: Works on different screen sizes
4. **Accessible**: Clear labels and color coding
5. **Professional**: Matches the app's design language

The pie chart implementation enhances the user experience by providing a visual representation of defect data, making it easier to understand the distribution of defects across different statuses for each severity level.
